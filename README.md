# 💸 Inter-Exchange Arbitrage Bot (Coinbase vs Kraken)

This Python bot compares crypto prices between **Coinbase** and **Kraken** to detect arbitrage opportunities in real-time.  
It simulates buying on the cheaper exchange and selling on the more expensive one — no actual trades are executed.

## 🧪 Testing

No API keys are required — all data is pulled from **public endpoints**.
You can safely test this without a trading account.

## 🔐 Environment File (.env)

Currently unused, but reserved for future API key support:

```
# .env (example)
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 🧠 Credits

Built by Garret.
Inspired by the idea of exploiting price differences between centralized exchanges for small, frequent wins.
